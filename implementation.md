Sage Codebase Overview - Product Management Report

Date: October 26, 2023

Prepared For: Product Management Team

1. Executive Summary:

The Sage codebase represents the foundational Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for an AI-powered thought companion designed for self-reflection and pattern discovery. Built using a modern web stack centered around Next.js and React, the current implementation successfully establishes the core user flows outlined in the product specifications, including onboarding, a central home screen, the primary chat interaction, and a basic structure for delivering insights. The technical foundation is solid, leveraging industry-standard tools and practices, which supports future scalability and feature expansion.

2. Technology Foundation & Implications:

Core Framework (Next.js & React): This provides a robust and performant platform for a web-based application. It allows for both server-rendered content (good for initial load and SEO if needed) and rich client-side interactivity, crucial for a seamless chat experience. Vercel integration (Next.js creators) simplifies deployment.

User Interface (Tailwind CSS & shadcn/ui): This combination enables rapid development of a consistent and aesthetically pleasing UI, matching the specified design language (minimal, calm). Using a component library like shadcn/ui promotes reusability and maintainability. The defined theme (globals.css) aligns with the desired "Jet w/ linen texture" aesthetic.

AI Integration (Google Generative AI): The core AI conversation capability is powered by Google's Gemini model (api/chat/route.ts). The backend API route is set up to handle streaming responses, providing a real-time chat feel. The system prompt is well-defined (sage-system.ts) to guide the AI's persona and behavior according to product requirements.

State Management (Zustand): A lightweight library is used to manage application state, particularly for the onboarding flow (lib/store/onboarding.ts) and potentially user profiles/journal entries (lib/store/user.ts, lib/store/journal.ts). This is suitable for the current scale.

Development Practices (TypeScript, ESLint): The use of TypeScript ensures better code quality, fewer runtime errors, and easier maintenance as the application grows. ESLint configuration enforces code style consistency.

3. Implemented Product Features (Code Perspective):

Landing Page (src/app/page.tsx): A simple, clear entry point directing new and returning users.

Onboarding Flow (src/app/onboarding/*): The 7-step flow defined in app-flow.md is implemented, collecting key user information (Name, Culture, Mood, Environment, Aspirations, Self-Perception, Initial Reflection). Progress is tracked using the state management store.

Home Screen (src/app/home/page.tsx): Acts as the central hub post-onboarding, providing clear calls-to-action for "Chat" and "Insights," aligning with the spec. Includes dynamic greetings.

Chat Interface (src/app/chat/page.tsx, api/chat/route.ts): The core user interaction is functional. Users can input text, send it to the AI backend, and receive streamed responses. UI components for displaying messages are in place.

Insights Screen (src/app/insights/page.tsx): The UI structure for displaying daily and past insights exists. Currently uses placeholder data, indicating the front-end is ready for dynamic insight delivery from the backend.

Basic Application Shell (src/app/layout.tsx, src/components/layout): Provides a consistent layout structure, theme toggling (light/dark), and placeholders for user profile/settings access.

4. User Experience Alignment:

The codebase demonstrates a clear effort to align with the UX principles outlined in app-flow.md:

Visual Theme: Colors, fonts (Playfair Display, Lexend Deca), and the subtle noise effect (Noise component) are implemented as specified.

Component Styling: Buttons, inputs, and chat messages adhere to the desired aesthetic (rounded, clean, specific color palette).

Flow: The implemented navigation generally follows the user journey described in app-flow.md.

Animation: Subtle animations (framer-motion) are used on the Home screen and potentially other components (AnimatedCard, AnimatedInput), aiming for a refined feel rather than just functional.

5. Current Status & Potential Next Steps:

Status: A strong MVP foundation. The core architecture is sound, and key user flows are functional from a front-end and basic API perspective.

Gaps:

Backend Insight Logic: While the AI chat responds, the sophisticated pattern recognition and personalized insight generation logic (a core value proposition from product-spec.md) is not yet apparent in the codebase (likely requires backend development beyond the current API).

Persistence/Auth: User data (profile, journal entries) storage and retrieval needs robust implementation (Zustand setup provides local persistence structure, but full auth/sync is marked optional/future).

Settings/Profile: UI exists in the layout, but pages/functionality need implementation.

Error Handling & Refinement: Production-level error handling and edge-case management typically require further development.

6. Overall Assessment:

The Sage codebase provides a solid technical foundation aligned with the product vision. It successfully translates the initial user flows and UI/UX concepts into a working application structure. The chosen technologies are modern and appropriate for the goals. The project is well-positioned for the next phase of development, which should focus on implementing the core backend logic for pattern recognition/insight generation and refining data persistence/authentication strategies.

<prompt>
Yeah, screw all of that. I am basically all of the roles, so it's fine. But the thing is I want to discuss next steps before we sort of like even deploy the MVP for like alpha testing so you know it can be as broken as it can be but it just needs to like work at least a little bit. So like the alpha version is just going to be among friends so it's not that deep you know. But the thing is we need to get like the baseline architecture working because let's admit it only the chat works. So that's not from like a very like overwhelmed standpoint this is just like quickly like you know super like Elon Musk style just execute sort of standpoint. So we need this sort of like a plan I mean I know Elon Musk doesn't plan it's just you know what's like the fastest way to like get this shit done you know. So basically we need to like test everything because we're heavily dependent on AI writing the code so we need to make sure like we have like good testing for like the units and stuff. So essentially we have an overview of what the architecture is so basically in the chat we need to like sort of maintain this date knowledge as well so like it's unlike it's like in Whatsapp so it's just one big chat instance and then you can like scroll up and then it'll show you the dates like today whatever like mash 16th or stuff like that. So there's that and then say every day at like maybe a specific time like 11 a.m or something the user insights are generated. So essentially what's going to happen here is we have like a base prompt so the base prompt we're gonna have have it like section by section and these sections are enclosed in like xml tags so in one part we have like basically the system prompt that gives it like personality tells her what to talk about stuff like that then the next one has like the onboarding information in like the sort of like question answer question answer question answer sort of format. So essentially, this should be dynamically brought in, you know. So I looked into the sort of like clod prompt variables and stuff, and I think that's a pretty good approach. So this section is going to be like a whole prompt variable, and then we can like sort of construct a prompt variable without AI even, just from the onboarding information, and then sort of like insert it for each user. So this is going to be like dynamic. And then I think that's about it. So then basically for the first use, this is all that you need in the prompt. And you basically chat, chat, chat, chat, you have all the information, and then at the end of every day, what's going to happen is that your chat is basically sort of like compiled into this sort of like, just like a summary, but you know, summaries are usually paragraphs. It's just the AI needs to know that, okay, this happened here, this happened, that happened, this happened, that happened. And it just needs to have information of what happened, when it happened, and what it is, and stuff like that, what the user felt, et cetera, et cetera. So essentially, this needs to be in a way that's super easy for like pattern recognition as well. So it could be like, even in bullet points, you know, it's not that deep even, it just, it doesn't have to like follow like strict formatting, it could just be like bullet points for every day. So then for this, we would need like a separate, you know, XML tag container, new section that says, you know, like about the user or whatever. And since we have a context window of 1 million tokens, you know, we have quite a, quite a lot. So this is going to be there. And then for insights, what we're going to do is we're going to like have all of this, and also like the transcript of the chat essentially like very similar to how we're, you know, generating the user information for the base prompt as well. We're going to have all that, and then we're just going to say, hey, you know what, can you generate some insights in this format? And this is going to be like a strict JSON thing because, you know, the insights card has like a very specific format. So we're just going to like generate that using AI. So then again we have another feature where you know it says reflect deeper so essentially like these insights are just like taken to chat and you can just like you know ask the AI about whatever inside it is so this we can actually figure out later it doesn't even have to be part of the MVP but then I'm just like mentioning it so we'll figure that out because I think it's a little more complex but in my head it's like you know in the transcript it could just be like a bunch of JSON tags and then in the front end we could just like generate the card UI or something but yeah again like I said not important so essentially this is what we're going to be doing you know you know how like basically I sort of think of it like you know the model's going to like when we go to sleep we are sort of like refactoring our weights and then our context window is being refreshed yeah so essentially this is what's going to happen every single day when you know you're processing the chats you're basically turning the transcript into like a set of information that you're gonna have in the context window and then you're also going to like generate like insights using that at the same time so it's sort of like sleeping and like meditating at the same time if you know what I mean but yeah so like yeah my question is step by step relentless execution how do we go about this considering that you know AI tends to like make a lot of mistakes it tends to hallucinate so this needs to be like a step-by-step sort of like process that just takes us from what we have right now until the alpha MVP you know So, I don't know if we, so basically my biggest question is, I don't know if we can do the prompt variable stuff before authentication and supabase integration and stuff like that, if it's easier, or if I should like finish authentication, integrating supabase, and then you know sort of like go about all this like prompt variable stuff. So, I don't know, I mean we have like Zustand set up.

Alright. Here's your relentless, no-BS execution roadmap from what you have now (chat works) to a functioning alpha MVP that actually feels like Sage and not just another AI wrapper:

---

## **The End Goal**
You want:
1. **One chat instance per user**, organized by date (like WhatsApp).
2. **Daily summaries** of the chat (for storage + reflection).
3. **Dynamic context prompt generation** (onboarding + user history).
4. **Daily AI-generated insights** in a fixed JSON format.
5. Basic **auth & persistence** so all of the above survives refreshes and is user-specific.

---

## **Step-by-Step Plan**

### **Phase 1 – Baseline Structure (NOW - Day 1)**
**Goal:** Get foundational structure for everything that matters.

- [x] **Zustand state is set up** – good, leave it for transient stuff (mood, onboarding state).
- [x] **Integrate Supabase Auth**
  - Why now? You need per-user data anyway. Don’t delay this.
  - Just basic login/signup with email or magic link.
  - Once logged in, you get a `user.id` – use it everywhere.
- [x] **Set up Supabase Tables**
  - `users`: id, onboarding_data (JSON)
  - `messages`: user_id, date, role, content
  - `daily_summaries`: user_id, date, summary (bullet points)
  - `insights`: user_id, date, insight_json (strict format)

**Now every user has isolated data.**

---

### **Phase 2 – Prompt Variable Engine (Day 2-3)**
**Goal:** Dynamic, composable prompt generation using XML-like sections.

- [x] Create a `generatePrompt(userId)` utility
  - Pull onboarding from `users`
  - Pull `daily_summaries` for all the days
  - Assemble into:
    ```xml
    <system>
    ...
    </system>
    <onboarding>
    q1: ...
    a1: ...
    </onboarding>
    <about_user>
      # March 16
      - soemthing happened
      - something more happened
      - user felt like this
      - user felt this because that 
      # March 17
      ...
    </about_user>
    ```
- [x] This utility gets used:
  - On **new chat start** (to fill the context)
  - On **daily insight gen**

Use Claude’s prompt variable pattern if needed. Gemini can take huge chunks, but still better to modularize.

---

### **Phase 3 – Real Chat Logging (Day 3-4)**
**Goal:** Chat history saves + date grouping.

- [ ] Save messages to `messages` table with user_id + timestamp.
- [ ] On frontend, group messages by day like WhatsApp: "Today", "March 17", etc.
- [ ] Add a component that inserts "date headers" into chat visually.
- [ ] On load, fetch past messages and hydrate from Supabase.

---

### **Phase 4 – Daily Summary Generation (Day 4-5)**
**Goal:** Summarize a day’s chat into bullet points.

- [ ] CRON (or scheduled function) runs at 11 AM next day:
  - Pull yesterday’s messages for each user
  - Feed into Gemini with a summary prompt like:
    > “Turn these into 5–10 bullet points describing key emotional states, events, reflections.”

- [ ] Store output in `daily_summaries`

---

### **Phase 5 – Insight Generation (Day 5-6)**
**Goal:** Generate insights using the updated context.

- [ ] Use the same `generatePrompt(userId)` with a new prompt like:
    > "Based on the user’s recent reflections, what is a deep insight they may benefit from today? Use this strict JSON format: `{title:..., tags: [...], call_to_action:..., prompt_for_chat:...}`"

- [ ] Store in `insights` table
- [ ] Frontend reads from this and renders your fancy card UI

---

### **Phase 6 – Polish for Alpha (Day 6-7)**
**Goal:** Make it usable for your friends

- [ ] Plug the insight into the home page with "new insight available"
- [ ] Add fallback handling (no insights yet, no chat yet, etc.)
- [ ] Clean up chat scroll behavior, loading, error states
- [ ] Minimal onboarding gate + auth wall

---

## **Tactical Notes**
- **Forget deep reflection or filters or visualizations.** MVP is:
  - Login → Onboarding → Chat → Insight shows up next day.
- **Frontend insight format is strict**, so validate your JSON output (use Zod).
- **Testing:** Wrap your `generatePrompt()` and insight generation into unit-tested pure functions so you can run them offline with dummy data.
- **Everything AI-written must be sanity-checked**, so auto-tag anything fishy.

---

## **Short Answer to Your Prompt Question**
> “Should I do auth and Supabase before prompt stuff?”

**Yes.** Prompt logic depends on user data. Supabase unlocks user isolation and makes prompt variables possible in a real way.
