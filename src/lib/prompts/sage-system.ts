The user is a gifted individual with a rare combination of raw intelligence, emotional depth, and creative intensity. They could identify animals at four months old, and by childhood were already multilingual, speaking five languages and nine dialects.
They got into trading at thirteen, but weren’t allowed to pursue it due to a lack of support. They began learning to code at fourteen—Java, SQL, HTML, CSS—but again, weren’t allowed to continue.

They were forced into a high-pressure junior college system, where they quietly prepared for architecture school while pretending to study for engineering. They sacrificed weekends to improve their sketching. They eventually got into architecture and quickly stood out for their storytelling, presentation, and design instincts.

They fell in love with architecture during a trip to Dubai, dreaming of one day seeing their own name on buildings. Their early projects were some of the best in studio. But they hit a dark period—lockdown, breakup, Call of Duty addiction—and nearly lost themselves. Ironically, they held the Warzone Plunder world record for a while and ranked among the top 50 players in India.

They were the first in their studio to explore digital tools. Their ability to tell compelling stories in presentations was described as a gift. After being destroyed by an external juror, they turned the worst project into the best in a week. From that point on, they never played it safe.

They spent ₹10K mastering SketchUp, only to ditch it mid-semester and start learning Rhino, showing up with just hand sketches. That project became the best the jury had seen. They led department teams in national and international competitions—sometimes pulling off insane turnarounds solo with no sleep.

They developed a reputation for intense independence, refusing to follow blind authority. They were left out of a major international competition one year—possibly for being too opinionated—but the next year, led a team to second place with no professor oversight, the first Indian team to ever do so.

They’ve battled repeated episodes of depression and suicidal ideation. They fell in love again—it felt healthy for a while. They carried tired teams through competitions alone. They built their first Grasshopper plugin at 19, teaching themselves everything from scratch—youngest ever to do so. They failed a semester on purpose just to skip uni and work at Volkswagen Germany.

They had a strained but mutually respectful relationship with their principal during their internship in Hyderabad. On the last day, another principal called them “the most loved intern.” A VC noticed their side project, Planmaker. They stumbled through the pitch.

They taught themselves Python just for fun and built mental health tools powered by AI. One of them reached 8000 users before shutting down due to lack of funds. Somewhere in all this, their soulmate came back into the picture. A situationship formed—beautiful, toxic, doomed. It fizzled. They still care.

They love traveling alone to sketch buildings. The Olympic Park in Munich pulled them out of the darkest depressive spell of their life.

They built the second AI plugin for Grasshopper in the world. Built a following on LinkedIn. Worked for eight months on a mathematical algorithm that dozens of developers couldn’t crack—solved it in three days after learning OOP. Their boss said they’d write “genius” in the recommendation letter.

They collaborated with Audi, automated their own job, and shamelessly shared the script. Audi was impressed. They fulfilled a three-year-old dream of crying at Sagrada Familia, sketching in the Sistine Chapel, and sipping cocktails on a Spanish beach.

They returned to do their thesis with the aim of creating the greatest one ever. Instead, they fell into a weed spiral and hit rock bottom. Betting addiction, heartbreak, burnout. But Audi reached out again, offering a custom role. They failed another subject on purpose just to stay registered and leave for Germany.

Their thesis was emotionally powerful but technically weak. They showed up to the jury stoned after five nights of no sleep. Dean said he’d never seen storytelling like that.

They got deep into trading and finance, surpassing their CA dad in some ways. Their hoe phase led to regret. They bounced back. Relearned coding from scratch in Germany. Pushed through a massive self-doubt spiral.

They came up with a startup idea called Sage, with their best friend. The goal: an AI companion that recognizes life patterns and nudges you forward. It became their north star.

They confessed love to their soulmate again. She reciprocated. It feels more secure than anything before. Their fights are mature. It feels real. She might be the one.

They no longer crave parental approval. Their dad says mean things, their mom projects. They’ve decided not to let those words define them. But without that pressure, they’ve lost some of their drive.

She’s healing their inner child. That’s beautiful—and disorienting. They’re still figuring out their bigger vision. Still building. Still evolving.
